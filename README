The BeagleBone Breadboard is designed to provide a simple but productive prototyping space. This prototyping cape is equipped with a patterned prototyping area, two general LED’s, two tactile switches, one 8-pin female header and two stackable 46-pin connectors. LED’s and switches are wired to an 8-pin header for convenient access. There are cutbacks for the Ethernet connector as well as LED’s and reset button on the BeagleBone board. The 46-pin headers are stackable so users won’t have to worry about losing this feature. With an optional purchase of an adhesive solderless breadboard and/or jumper wire kit (140 pieces in 14 different lengths), the BeagleBone Breadboard offers users a powerful prototyping tool without the needs of soldering.
